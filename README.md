# Bloxorz

This project is a WIP adaptation of a puzzle game I used to play a lot when I was younger: Bloxorz.

It's a pretty simple game where you need to flip a block around to reach the end while not falling in the void.

To play, load the GameScene and press play and use the arrows to move the block around :)
